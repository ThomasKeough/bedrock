# Pokemon TCG - Team 158

# Problem Domain
In our initial problem domain from week 3, we were focused on using the PokémonTCG API to implement a simple version 
of the Pokémon game. While we wanted to add certain gimmicks and challenges to our version of the game, implementing 
the game's core functionality turned out to be much more difficult than we thought. As a result, most of the time 
spent implementing the project was focused on getting a simple version of the game to run. Given more time, we could 
probably implement these challenges and gimmicks. Some ideas for future improvements could be modifying card statistics
(health, attack values, resistances, weaknesses, etc.) to increase difficulty for players.

# Our Application
Our proposed core features included: 
* Player Collection
* Deck Building
* Gameplay

Some other features we thought of implementing were booster packs, currency systems, and experience systems. 
Unfortunately, we were focusing on our implementation of game loop, and didn't get around to implementing these 
additional features. As for our core functionality, we successfully implemented these features, and are quite proud of 
how this project turned out. 

# Technical Problems
During the first few weeks of the project, our team wasn't too sure on how to begin implementing this software. As this
was our first time implementing software that adhered to clean architecture and SOLID, we weren't sure on how our code 
could achieve proper functionality and also follow these design practices.
