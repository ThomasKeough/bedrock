# API of Choice
The API we've chosen to work with is called [PokémonTCG](https://pokemontcg.io). It provides an extensive database of 
Pokémon cards which we can use to build player collections and decks, which can then be used to play the game. It is a 
REST API that uses the standard HTTP codes for queries. When queried, it will return Pokémon cards in JSON format.
